# ðŸ§  Machine Learning from Scratch

This project is a hands-on implementation of foundational machine learning algorithms **from scratch** using pure Python and NumPyâ€”without relying on libraries like scikit-learn for model training.

It's built for educational purposes to deepen your understanding of how ML models work under the hood.
